# Using Pitot Tubes To Measure Air Velocities and Flows

A repository of code and STEP files to illustrate the use of Pitot codes as described in [my article](https://nunrg.eu/posts/pitot-tubes/).

The STEP files are for a simple free-airflow Pitot tube, used to measure relative airspeed, and an averaging Pitot tube for a 150mm reound air duct, used for measuring air flow inside an air duct.

The .ino file is the code for a simple Arduino system used to calculate air velocities based on readings from a Sensirion SDP810 sensor. It also provides raw pressure and temperature values and displays everything on a simple 2 lines by 16 character LCD.
